# NeVeX Investing
NeVeX Introduced To The World Of Investing!

#### Todos:

* Clean up the bad stock tickers (go through them)
* Mark tickers as bad
* Move to using the StockTickerService, not the repo for looping
* Figure out how to use the yahoo service better
* Use the ftp to get the tickers:
  * ftp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/symboldirectory (files in there need to be read)
  * http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=symboldirdefs
* Use Gradle 3 or 4 (2.3 used, since there's problems upgrading to 3 - no classes found etc)
